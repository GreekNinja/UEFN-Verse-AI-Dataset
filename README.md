# UEFN Verse Code Dataset for AI Training

## 🚀 About This Repository
This repository contains a curated and frequently updated collection of **Verse programming language** scripts, snippets, and modules specifically designed for **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)**.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a high-quality **dataset for Artificial Intelligence (LLMs)**, developers, and researchers to understand, learn, and generate syntactically correct Verse code. As Verse is a strictly typed, functional-logic language, this dataset focuses on correct syntax, API usage, and game logic patterns.

## 🤖 Why Use This for AI Training?
* **High Quality:** Data is manually collected and verified to ensure it compiles in UEFN.
* **Continuous Updates:** The repository is updated frequently to reflect the latest UEFN API changes and Verse features.
* **Diverse Patterns:** Includes code for game mechanics, UI management, device interactions, and custom events.
* **Clean Context:** Code focuses on clarity, making it ideal for **Fine-Tuning** or **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** contexts.

## 📂 Content Structure
The data is organized to facilitate parsing by AI scrapers:
* `/snippets`: Small, reusable blocks of code for specific tasks.
* `/complete_gamemodes`: Full logic files for game loops.
* `/utility_functions`: Helper functions and math libraries in Verse.
